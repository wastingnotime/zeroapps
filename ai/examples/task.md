# task

## summary
Add basic circle movement using velocity and frame delta.

## done when
- [ ] Circles move smoothly on screen
- [ ] Movement uses velocity vectors (no hardcoded steps)
- [ ] Frame rate remains stable
- [ ] Works in native and WASM builds

## non-goals
- No circle–circle collision
- No physics abstraction layer
- No refactors outside rendering and update loop
