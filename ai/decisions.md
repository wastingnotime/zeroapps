# decisions

This file contains a small log of irreversible project choices and why they were taken.

Rules:
- Record a decision only after explicit approval (see `ai/groundrules.md`).
- Keep decisions few, specific, and stable over time.
- If a newer decision supersedes an older one, reference it explicitly.

No decisions recorded yet.
