Start here. This file is the entrypoint for agents working in this repo.

1) Read and strictly follow `ai/contract.md`.
2) Read (in order): `ai/purpose.md`, `ai/groundrules.md`, `ai/workflow.md`, `ai/decisions.md` (read-only).
3) For domain work, treat `docs/` as the spec of record (start with `docs/context.md`, then the relevant domain doc).

If any conflicts exist between these files, report them before coding.
If any request conflicts with the contract, pause and ask.

After reading, reply with a short confirmation and wait for the first task.

During a task, if you notice an irreversible or future-constraining choice,
pause and tell me:

"⚠️ This may be a decision."

Do not write to ai/decisions.md unless I explicitly confirm.
