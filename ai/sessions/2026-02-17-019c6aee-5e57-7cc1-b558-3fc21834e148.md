## Handoff Notes

1. Added root `AGENTS.md` contributor guide (“Repository Guidelines”).
2. Designed aggregate concurrency approach (`expected_version` + `command_id` idempotency).
3. Implemented `svc/catcare` optimistic-concurrency service and tests.
4. Added generic `store/` package with in-memory event store and snapshot interfaces.
5. Added `cmd/catcare-cli` command adapter; verified with `go test ./...`.
6. Migrated session tracking to `ai/sessions/`, then recovered and recorded repo-related session IDs.
