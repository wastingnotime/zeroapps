## Handoff Notes

1. Reviewed `AGENTS.md` and AI contract files before implementation.
2. Implemented `RegisteredCats` projection with idempotent per-stream-version apply semantics.
3. Wired projection updates into `svc/catcare` append flow and added service publication test coverage.
4. Added projection tests for empty, single, multiple, and idempotent re-apply scenarios.
5. Ran `go test ./...` successfully and marked `task.md` done criteria as complete.
6. Re-scoped `task.md` to SQLite persistence for `catcare-cli` status across runs.
7. Added `store.SQLiteStore` with SQLite schema, optimistic concurrency checks, and catcare event encode/decode.
8. Added replay support to rebuild projections from persisted events on CLI startup.
9. Updated `cmd/catcare-cli` to use `-db` and SQLite-backed storage instead of in-memory store.
10. Added SQLite store tests for append/load and concurrency conflict behavior.
11. Ran `go test ./...` successfully after adding SQLite dependency and updated roadmap milestone.
